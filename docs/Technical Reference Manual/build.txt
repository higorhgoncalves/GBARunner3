How to compile GBARunner3:

Install the latest version of DevKitPRO from their official repo: https://github.com/devkitPro/installer/releases
Clone GBARunner3 repo with submodules in your workspace:
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Gericom/GBARunner3.git
Run make inside the /code folder, you should get GBARunner3.nds inside /code/bootstrap.
NOTE: Currently only Windows is able to compile, Linux/macOS users may get a fix in the future.
To run it, you need:

TwilightMenu++ 26.1.1 or higher already installed in your SD card/flashcard.
Move your previously compiled GBARunner3.nds inside /_nds/TWiLightMenu/emulators folder in your SD card.
Get (on your own) retail GBA bios, rename it as bios.bin and put it inside the /_gba folder in your SD card.
Get the configs folder from the repository you cloned, copy it inside of the /_gba folder, it should be /_gba/configs.
Write GBARUNNER3_TEST = 1 text line under the [SRLOADER] section in /_nds/TWiLightMenu/settings.ini
If you're using a flashcard, compatibility has been fixed, so will be able to run this as well.
